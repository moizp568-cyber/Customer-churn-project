# Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on a telecom customer dataset to understand *customer churn behavior* and identify the key factors that influence customers leaving the service.  
The analysis is designed from a *business decision-making perspective*, helping companies improve customer retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze overall customer churn patterns
- Study the impact of *demographics* (gender, senior citizen)
- Understand how *services, billing methods, and contracts* affect churn
- Compare churn behavior across different *SIM operators*
- Generate actionable insights to reduce customer churn

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *Pandas & NumPy* – Data cleaning and manipulation
- *Matplotlib* – Data visualization
- *Google Colab* – Analysis environment
- *CSV Dataset* – Telecom customer data

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer-level telecom data including:
- Customer demographics (Gender, Senior Citizen)
- Service usage (Internet, Phone, Streaming, Security, Tech Support)
- Billing details (Payment Method, Monthly Charges, Paperless Billing)
- Contract information (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year)
- Customer tenure and churn status
- SIM operators (Airtel, BSNL, Jio, Vi)

---

## 📈 Analysis & Visualizations
The project includes *20+ business-focused visualizations*, such as:
- Overall churn distribution
- Churn by gender and senior citizen
- Internet & phone service usage analysis
- Contract type vs churn
- Payment method impact on churn
- Monthly charges comparison by SIM operator
- Tenure-based customer lifecycle analysis
- Region-wise demographic analysis

All charts are designed to clearly communicate trends and patterns to non-technical stakeholders.

---

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Converted *TotalCharges* from text to numeric format
- Handled missing and invalid values without dropping records
- Ensured dataset consistency for reliable analysis  
(This preprocessing step improves analysis quality and robustness.)

---

## 💡 Key Business Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers show significantly higher churn
- Senior citizens are more likely to churn than non-senior customers
- Fiber optic users exhibit higher churn compared to DSL users
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn
- Customers with shorter tenure are more prone to leave
- SIM operator–specific retention strategies are required

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Perform structured *Exploratory Data Analysis*
- Handle real-world data cleaning challenges
- Extract *business-driven insights*
- Communicate findings using clear visual storytelling  

The analysis can serve as a strong foundation for *predictive churn modeling* and strategic decision-making in telecom businesses.
